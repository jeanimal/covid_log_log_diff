covid_state_mandates.csv is data for several states sourced from
https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections

There are four categories tracked.
- Stay at home order, called "stayhome" in the csv
- Educational facilities closed, called "schools" in the csv
- Non-essential services closed, called "closed" in the csv
- Travel severly limited, called "travel" in the csv


The website explains:

These dates pertain only to government-mandated measures implemented for the entire population within the selected location.

For example:
- If a stay-at-home order is issued only for the elderly, since this is not a general population order, the coding would be Not implemented.
- If a school-closure order is issued at the city level, but not at the government level of the selected location, the coding would be Not implemented.
