# Covid log-log-diff plots

This app plots covid-19 trends in a way that makes it easier to
see if we are flattening the growth.  As long as the points march
in a straight line, the exponential growth is constant.  When the
points head down, our social distancing is working. 

A full explanation and animated plots per country are in this video:
